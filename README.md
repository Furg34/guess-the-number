# guess-the-number

WORK IN PROGRESS...

A number guessing game for use on any operating system.

Learning to code... 

The ultimate goal is to build a cross platform number guessing game using c++

Some other goals that come to mind for a good number guessing game - To be added as my knowledge of programming expands.
 - 2 player game or maybe even an X amount of players.
 - Goal is to guess a number between 1 and 100.
 - Player can choose the number and computer guesses or computer choses number and player guesses.
 - You may also play against another human if you choose.
 - The computer can be set to "Hard, Normal, or Easy".
 - Compete in a best of 5 series.
 - "Toss a coin" to see who goes first.
